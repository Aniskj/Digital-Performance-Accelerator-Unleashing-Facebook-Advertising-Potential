### Objective

### Business Objective
To align data-driven insights with XYZ Company's business aspirations by optimizing conversions and ad performance while effectively managing the advertising budget.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Unique IDs for each ad (ad_id), campaign IDs (xyz_campaign_id, fb_campaign_id).
- Demographic details such as age and gender of the ad viewers.
- Interest categories to which the viewers belong.
- Performance metrics including impressions, clicks, amount spent, total conversions (inquiries), and approved conversions (purchases).

### Analysis Approach
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Conversion Rate (CR): Percentage of users who take action after viewing an ad.
   - Click-Through Rate (CTR): Proportion of users who clicked out of the total ad viewers.
   - Cost Per Click (CPC): Cost for each click generated by an ad.
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Total anticipated revenue from a customer over their association with the company.
   
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding the relationship between impressions, clicks, conversions, and ad spend to identify factors influencing approved conversions.

3. **Demographic Analysis**: Examining engagement across different age groups and genders to tailor marketing strategies.

4. **Campaign Performance Analysis**: Evaluating campaigns based on CR, CTR, CPC, and budget allocation to determine effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

5. **A/B Testing**: Conducting statistical tests to validate the significance of differences between campaign performances.

6. **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting customers based on their CLV to identify valuable customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

### Insights

   - Campaign 3 excels in reach and conversions due to a larger budget.
   - Campaign 2 shows the highest mean CR and CTR, indicating effective engagement and cost-efficiency.
   - Campaign 1 performs moderately in terms of CR and CTR but is cost-efficient.

2. **Demographic Engagement**:
   - Campaigns 2 and 3 engage the 30-34 age group more effectively, while Campaign 1 performs better with the 40-44 age group.
   - All campaigns show consistent engagement across genders, indicating broad appeal.

3. **Key Performance Indicators**:
   - Significant positive correlation between impressions and approved conversions, highlighting the importance of ad visibility.
   - Weaker correlation between clicks and approved conversions, suggesting that not all clicks lead to sales.

4. **Customer Lifetime Value**:

4. **A/B Testing for Precision**: Implement A/B testing to understand the impact of different budget levels and creative elements on campaign performance.
5. **Leverage CLV Insights**: Tailor marketing efforts to high CLV segments with personalized offers and loyalty programs to enhance long-term profitability.
6. **Enhance User Engagement**: Establish forums or platforms to gather direct consumer feedback post-launch to address concerns and improve future campaigns.
